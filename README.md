# robotic-waste-segregator
Many times people have difficulty segregating the waste. The mixed waste releases harmful gases But we also know that effective segregation of wastes means that less waste goes to landfill which makes it cheaper and better for people and the environment.  To solve this problem, i have made this robot that can segregate dry waste and wet waste.
